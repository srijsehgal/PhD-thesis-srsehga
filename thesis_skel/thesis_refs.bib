journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {ELVES have been regularly studied since 2013 with the twenty-four telescopes of the Pierre Auger Observatory, exploiting a dedicated trigger and extended readout. A large fraction of the observed events shows double ELVES within the time window, and, in some cases, even more complex structures are observed. We classify double ELVES using the radial variation of the time gap and the photon flux ratio between flashes. Such parameters may be related to the different types of lightning in which they originated. We will review the cross correlations of the ELVES light emissions with the radio waves detected by the antennas of the ENTLN network, active in Argentina since late 2018. Further improvements of our detection and classification algorithms were achieved by detecting ELVES from closer lightning: since December 2020, the ELVES trigger was extended to the three High Elevation Auger Telescopes (HEAT), which observe the night sky at elevation angles between 30 and 60 degrees, with an enhanced time resolution (50 ns time binning). Both single and double ELVES are recorded with unprecedented time and space resolution. Events from the first year of data taking will be shown.}

The production of secondary cosmogenic neutrinos and photons and the constraints their observation would imply for the UHECRs origin are also addressed. Finally, we conclude by briefly discussing the relevance of a multi messenger approach for solving the mystery of UHECRs.}

  abstract  = {This paper presents the results of different searches for correlations between very high-energy neutrino candidates detected by IceCube and the highest-energy cosmic rays measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array. We first consider samples of cascade neutrino events and of high-energy neutrino-induced muon tracks, which provided evidence for a neutrino flux of astrophysical origin, and study their cross-correlation with the ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) samples as a function of angular separation. We also study their possible directional correlations using a likelihood method stacking the neutrino arrival directions and adopting different assumptions on the size of the UHECR magnetic deflections. Finally, we perform another likelihood analysis stacking the UHECR directions and using a sample of through-going muon tracks optimized for neutrino point-source searches with sub-degree angular resolution. No indications of correlations at discovery level are obtained for any of the searches performed. The smallest of the p-values comes from the search for correlation between UHECRs with IceCube high-energy cascades, a result that should continue to be monitored.}

  abstract = {Neutrinos interact only very weakly with matter, but giant detectors have succeeded in detecting small numbers of astrophysical neutrinos. Aside from a diffuse background, only two individual sources have been identified: the Sun and a nearby supernova in 1987. A multiteam collaboration detected a high-energy neutrino event whose arrival direction was consistent with a known blazar—a type of quasar with a relativistic jet oriented directly along our line of sight. The blazar, TXS 0506+056, was found to be undergoing a gamma-ray flare, prompting an extensive multiwavelength campaign. Motivated by this discovery, the IceCube collaboration examined lower-energy neutrinos detected over the previous several years, finding an excess emission at the location of the blazar. Thus, blazars are a source of astrophysical neutrinos. Science, this issue p. 147, p. eaat1378 A blazar has been found to be a point source of astrophysical neutrinos, emitted over several years. A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5σ evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that blazars are identifiable sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux.}

  abstract  = {Some general features of cosmic ray acceleration are summarized along with some inferences that can be drawn concerning the origin of the UHE component. The UHE luminosity density is found to be similar to that derived for GeV cosmic rays and its slope suggests a distinct origin. Reports of clustering on small angular scale, if confirmed, would rule out most proposed source models. More generally, it is argued that the highest energy particles can only be accelerated in sites that can sustain an EMF  ℰ ≳ 3 × 1020 V and an associated power Lmin ≳ ℰ2/Z ~ 1039 W, where Z is the characteristic, electrical impedance, typically ≲ 100 Ω. Shock acceleration, unipolar induction and magnetic flares are the three most potent, observed, acceleration mechanisms and radio jet termination shocks, γ-ray blast waves, dormant black holes in galactic nuclei and magnetars are the least implausible, “conventional” manifestations of these mechanisms that have been invoked to explain the UHE cosmic rays. Each of these models presents problems and deciding between these and “exotic” origins for UHE cosmic rays, including those involving new particles or defects will require improved statistical information on the energies, arrival times and directions, as should be provided by the AUGER project.}

The accompanying cumulative neutrino background above ~PeV may be detectable by upcoming neutrino telescopes such as IceCube or KM3NeT, providing a test of this scenario as well as a probe of cosmic-ray confinement properties in clusters.}

  abstract  = {Galaxy clusters are the largest objects in the Universe kept together by gravity. Most of their baryonic content is made of a magnetized diffuse plasma. We investigate the impact of such a magnetized environment on the propagation of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). The intracluster medium (ICM) is described according to the self-similar assumption, in which gas density and pressure profiles are fully determined by the cluster mass and redshift. The magnetic field is scaled to the thermal components of the ICM under different assumptions. We model the propagation of UHECRs in the ICM using a modified version of the Monte Carlo code SimProp, where hadronic processes and diffusion in the turbulent magnetic field are implemented. We provide a universal parameterization that approximates the UHECR fluxes escaping from the environment as a function of the most relevant quantities, such as the mass of the cluster, the position of the source with respect to the center of the cluster, and the nature of the accelerated particles. We show that galaxy clusters are an opaque environment, especially for UHECR nuclei. The role of the most massive nearby clusters in the context of the emerging UHECR astronomy is finally discussed.}

The decay of SHDM represents also a possible source of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR), with a reliably calculated spectrum of the particles produced in the decay (∝E-1.9). The SHDM model for the production of UHECR can explain quantitatively only the excess of UHE events observed by AGASA. In the case of an observed spectrum not showing the AGASA excess the SHDM model can provide only a subdominant contribution to the UHECR flux. We discuss here the basic features of SHDM for the production of a subdominant UHECR flux, we refer our study to the possible signatures of the model at the Auger observatory discussing in particular the expected chemical composition and anisotropy.}

  abstract = {Cosmic-ray particles with energies in excess of 1020eV have been detected. The sources as well as the physical mechanism(s) responsible for endowing cosmic-ray particles with such enormous energies are unknown. This report gives a review of the physics and astrophysics associated with the questions of origin and propagation of these extremely high-energy (EHE) cosmic-rays in the Universe. After a brief review of the observed cosmic rays in general and their possible sources and acceleration mechanisms, a detailed discussion is given of possible “top-down” (non-acceleration) scenarios of origin of EHE cosmic rays through decay of sufficiently massive particles originating from processes in the early Universe. The massive particles can come from collapse and/or annihilation of cosmic topological defects (such as monopoles, cosmic strings, etc.) associated with Grand Unified Theories or they could be some long-lived metastable supermassive relic particles that were created in the early Universe and are decaying in the current epoch. The highest energy end of the cosmic-ray spectrum can thus be used as a probe of new fundamental physics beyond Standard Model. We discuss the role of existing and proposed cosmic-ray, gamma-ray and neutrino experiments in this context. We also discuss how observations with next generation experiments of images and spectra of EHE cosmic-ray sources can be used to obtain new information on Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields and possibly their origin.}

The upgrade program includes: the installation of a plastic scintillator detector (SSD) and of a radio antenna on top of each water-Cherenkov detector (WCD) of the surface array, an extension of the dynamic range of measurement through an additional small photomultiplier tube inside the WCD, new electronics to process signals from the WCD and the SSD with higher sampling frequency and enhanced resolution in amplitude. An array of underground scintillator detectors will measure the muonic component of lower energy extensive air showers. After presenting the motivations for upgrading the Observatory, an overview of the detectors is provided, together with the deployment and commissioning status.}

The angular accuracy of the surface detector is directly extracted from the data itself and on an event by event basis, and is given as a function of the number of stations triggered by the event and of the zenith angle of the shower. We compare the angular resolution of the surface detector obtained from hybrid events with the one obtained from the surface detector alone.}

Their belief that both protons and negative electrons were to be found in the nucleus arose from the observations that protons could be knocked out of light elements by alpha‐particle bombardment, while electrons emerged spontaneously (mostly from very heavy nuclei) in radioactive beta decay. Any other elementary constituent of the atom would have been considered superfluous, and to imagine that another might exist was abhorrent to the prevailing natural philosophy.}},

By using heavy water as a detection medium, the SNO experiment demonstrated clearly that solar electron neutrinos from 8B decay in the solar core change into other active neutrino flavors in transit to Earth. The reaction on deuterium that has equal sensitivity to all active neutrino flavors also provides a very accurate measure of the initial solar flux for comparison with solar models. This review summarizes the results from three phases of solar neutrino detection as well as other physics results obtained from analyses of the SNO data.}

(10.1126/science.1242856; see the cover) report data obtained between 2010 and 2012 with the IceCube neutrino detector that reveal the presence of a high-energy neutrino flux containing the most energetic neutrinos ever observed, including 28 events at energies between 30 and 1200 TeV. Although the origin of this flux is unknown, the findings are consistent with expectations for a neutrino population with origins outside the solar system. The IceCube observatory at the South Pole detected neutrinos from outside our solar system. We report on results of an all-sky search for high-energy neutrino events interacting within the IceCube neutrino detector conducted between May 2010 and May 2012. The search follows up on the previous detection of two PeV neutrino events, with improved sensitivity and extended energy coverage down to about 30 TeV. Twenty-six additional events were observed, substantially more than expected from atmospheric backgrounds. Combined, both searches reject a purely atmospheric origin for the 28 events at the 4σ level. These 28 events, which include the highest energy neutrinos ever observed, have flavors, directions, and energies inconsistent with those expected from the atmospheric muon and neutrino backgrounds. These properties are, however, consistent with generic predictions for an additional component of extraterrestrial origin.}

We conduct a study of the NMO sensitivity with atmospheric neutrinos using 9.3 years of IceCube DeepCore data, where a new event selection, reconstruction method, particle identification, and systematic uncertainty modeling are used. The goals of this analysis consist of: (1) probing the NMO at neutrino baselines that are not accessible to long-baseline accelerator experiments, (2) contributing to NMO global fit studies in an important and unique way, (3) serving as a detailed study on the NMO in preparation for the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, which should significantly improve the DeepCore NMO sensitivity.},

  journal   = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
  abstract  = {Over the last decade, observations have shown that the mean mass of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) increases progressively toward the highest energies. However, the precise composition is still unknown and several theoretical studies hint at the existence of a subdominant proton component up to the highest energies. Motivated by the exciting prospect of performing charged-particle astronomy with ultra-high-energy (UHE) protons we quantify the level of UHE-proton flux that is compatible with present multimessenger observations and the associated fluxes of neutral messengers produced in the interactions of the protons. We study this scenario with numerical simulations of two independent populations of extragalactic sources and perform a fit to the combined UHECR energy spectrum and composition observables, constrained by diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino observations. We find that up to of order 10% of the cosmic rays at the highest energies can be UHE protons, although the result depends critically on the selected hadronic interaction model for the air showers. Depending on the maximum proton energy (E max p) and the redshift evolution of sources, the associated flux of cosmogenic neutrinos and UHE gamma rays can significantly exceed the multimessenger signal of the mixed-mass cosmic rays. Moreover, if E max p is above the GZK limit, we predict a large flux of UHE neutrinos above EeV energies that is absent in alternate scenarios for the origin of UHECRs. We present the implications and opportunities afforded by these UHE proton, neutrino and photon fluxes for future multimessenger observations.}

After explaining the basic relations between air shower observables and the primary mass and energy of cosmic rays, we present different approaches and results of composition studies with surface detectors. Furthermore, we discuss measurements of the longitudinal development of air showers from non-imaging Cherenkov detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The interpretation of these experimental results in terms of primary mass is highly susceptible to the theoretical uncertainties of hadronic interactions in air showers. We nevertheless attempt to calculate the logarithmic mass from the data using different hadronic interaction models and to study its energy dependence from 1015eV to 1020eV.}

  abstract = {{Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are a viable candidate for the relic abundance of dark matter (DM) produced in the early universe. So far, WIMPs have eluded direct detection through interactions with baryonic matter. Neutrino emission from accumulated WIMP annihilations in the solar core has been proposed as a signature of DM, but has not yet been detected. These null results may be due to small-scale DM density fluctuations in the halo with the density of our local region being lower than the average (∼0.3 GeV cm−3). However, the accumulated neutrino signal from WIMP annihilations in the Galactic stellar disc would be insensitive to local density variations. Inside the disc, DM can be captured by stars causing an enhanced annihilation rate and therefore a potentially higher neutrino flux than what would be observed from elsewhere in the halo. We estimate a neutrino flux from the WIMP annihilations in the stellar disc to be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude compared to the neutrino fluxes from the halo. We offer a conservative estimate for this enhanced flux, based on the WIMP–nucleon cross-sections obtained from direct-detection experiments by assuming a density of ∼0.3 GeV cm−3 for the local DM. We also compare the detectability of these fluxes with a signal of diffuse high-energy neutrinos produced in the Milky Way by the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium. These comparative signals should be observable by large neutrino detectors.}},

  abstract = {The AMADEUS system is an integral part of the ANTARES neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea. The project aims at the investigation of techniques for acoustic neutrino detection in the deep sea. Installed at a depth of more than 2000m, the acoustic sensors of AMADEUS are based on piezo-ceramics elements for the broad-band recording of signals with frequencies ranging up to 125kHz. AMADEUS was completed in May 2008 and comprises six “acoustic clusters”, each one holding six acoustic sensors that are arranged at distances of roughly 1m from each other. The clusters are installed with inter-spacings ranging from 15 to 340m. Acoustic data are continuously acquired and processed at a computer cluster where online filter algorithms are applied to select a high-purity sample of neutrino-like signals. In total, 1.6TB of data were recorded in 2008 and 3.2TB in 2009. In order to assess the background of neutrino-like signals in the deep sea, the characteristics of ambient noise and transient signals have been investigated. In this article, the AMADEUS system will be described and recent results will be presented.}

  abstract  = {The analysis of high-energy air shower data allows one to study the proton-air cross section at energies beyond the reach of fixed target and collider experiments. The mean depth of the first interaction point and its fluctuations are a measure of the proton-air particle production cross section. Since the first interaction point in air cannot be measured directly, various methods have been developed in the past to estimate the depth of the first interaction from air shower observables in combination with simulations. As the simulations depend on assumptions made for hadronic particle production at energies and phase space regions not accessible in accelerator experiments, the derived cross sections are subject to significant systematic uncertainties. The focus of this work is the development of an improved analysis technique that allows a significant reduction of the model dependence of the derived cross section at very high energy. Performing a detailed Monte Carlo study of the potential and the limitations of different measurement methods, we quantify the dependence of the measured cross section on the hadronic interaction model used. Based on these results, a general improvement of the analysis methods is proposed by introducing the actually derived cross section already in the simulation of reference showers. The reduction of the model dependence is demonstrated for one of the measurement methods.}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {The Pierre Auger Cosmic-Ray Observatory uses the earth's atmosphere as a calorimeter to measure extensive air-showers created by particles of astrophysical origin. Some of these particles carry joules of energy. At these extreme energies, test beams are not available in the conventional sense. Yet understanding the energy response of the observatory is important. For example, the propagation distance of the highest energy cosmic-rays through the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) is predicted to be strong function of energy. This paper will discuss recently reported results from the observatory and the use of calibrated pulsed UV laser "test-beams" that simulate the optical signatures of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The status of the much larger 200,000 km3 companion detector planned for the northern hemisphere will also be outlined.}

  abstract = {The Pierre Auger Observatory detects ultra-high energy cosmic rays by implementing two complementary air-shower measurements. The combination of the single tank information from the surface detector (SD) and the calorimetric measurements of the shower profile using the fluorescence detector (FD), known as the “hybrid” technique, provides a more reliable event reconstruction than using either detector alone. In this paper the approach used to evaluate the cosmic ray flux using this class of events is described. The analysis method is discussed considering its main steps: the event selection, the detector up time evaluation and the exposure calculation.}
